## About
Motivate is a decentralized platform that empowers users to accomplish their goals using smart contracts and Ethereum. You choose a goal, set up incentives, and the blockchain will keep you on track. 

Here’s What Make Motivate Unique:
* **Compelling**: Unlike other apps that are easy to ignore when the going gets tough, Motivate provides strong incentives to help you stick with your goals.
* **Transparent**: Your friends and supporters can keep an eye on your project by viewing the tamper-proof Ethereum public blockchain with our easy to use interface.
* **Flexibile**: Templates provide anyone with the ability to create their own goals and incentives that fit their needs.
Hassle Free To Use: No need to attach your e-mail, create a password, or provide your identity.

Apps like [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/) are easy to ignore and highly specialized. Motivate gives you the power to accomplish your goals, your way.

Example: Nick has a goal to write a novel. He needs to write 500 words a day for 90 days in order to complete his novel. Nick uses Motivate to help complete his goal. He puts an incentive of 50 ether towards the goal. Friends and supporters can track Nick’s progress and validate that he isn’t cheating his goal. Every day that Nick does not submit 500 words he loses 1 ether. At the end of 90 days, he gets refunded the remaining ether plus a permanent shout-out on the blockchain to show off to his supporters.
